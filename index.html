        <h2>Starting My Journey in Website Development</h2>

         <p>Hey! So I thought I’d start this blog to share a bit about my journey as an IT student. Out of all the areas in tech, web development really caught my attention. 
        I love how you can write some code and instantly see something take shape on the screen.</p>
        <p>For me, it’s the mix of creativity and logic that makes it fun. I get to design and problem-solve at the same time. I’m still learning, but that’s exactly why I wanted to document the process. 
            Expect posts about projects I’m working on, mistakes I make, and the little wins along the way.</p>

        <h2>My First Website Project</h2>

          <p>So, my first web project was a simple portfolio site along with a currency calculator. Honestly, it wasn’t the prettiest thing ever, but it felt so good to build something from scratch. 
        I learned that planning a layout before coding saves a lot of stress, and making a site responsive is trickier than it looks</p>
        <p>Even though the design makes me cringe a little now, I’m proud of it. It was my first real step into website development, and it gave me the push to keep going.
             Next up, I want to add more interactivity and just keep experimenting.</p>

        <p>Hi! I’m a student and the University of the West Indies studying Information Technology with a big passion for web development. 
        I love bringing ideas to life through clean, creative, and user-friendly websites. Outside of my studies, I spend a lot of time experimenting with new tools, coding projects, and learning ways to improve my design and development skills.
